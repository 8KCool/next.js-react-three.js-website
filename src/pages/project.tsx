                    We are developing a new layer 1 blockchain as the data
                    facilitation layer of our smart city operating system. We
                    have taken a new approach to blockchain, which leans more
                    towards the original ideals of the Bitcoin White-paper and
                    away from the more recent Proof of Stake projects. However,
                    we donâ€™t use Proof of Work and have created our novel
                    consensus mechanism for real-world environments, which has
                    far greater potential than existing solutions. This allows
                    us a broader scope to tackle more significant problems than
                    would otherwise be possible due to the constraints of
                    current technologies.

                  <p className="text-[1.7rem]">
                    So what do we do differently? We are more a technology
                    company than a typical Web3 startup, so we are building with
                    practical objectives and are not anonymous - we are fully
                    doxxed. Philosophically, we are a Social Enterprise as,
                    although we are not registered as one, we will hard-code
                    protections to ensure a fair, equitable and reasonable
                    solution for everyone, regardless of background.<br></br><br></br>Our
                    blockchain is the base layer of our smart city operating
                    system. It is designed for data facilitation - to store data
                    as safely and economically as possible with integrated
                    urban data validation. It will keep both immutable and
                    mutable data while enabling a new kind of integration
                    between our real and digital selves, facilitated by our
                    utility NFT-based and validated Trigan Citizenship.<br></br>This
                    access NFT is required to ensure that there is only one
                    active identity per unique person to enable fair processes.
                    For example, we are introducing a new kind of universal
                    basic income and other local economy-related enablements. It
                    is also essential for fully democratic voting processes.

                    City data represent the digital wealth of cities but also represent opportunity, sadly underutilised until now. Failure to capture and sufficiently analyse population data will lead to avoidable deaths and poorer health outcomes. More informed decisions are likely to have positive results, whether in construction, urban planning or any other data-driven decision in an urban community.

                    Despite technology advancing quickly, the smart city space remains fragmented. There are islands of data primarily disconnected, and all smart urban communities have different approaches. While there may be a wealth of potentially available data, it is typically not accessible. If it is available, access can be challenging to arrange, and data will be organised in many bespoke, different ways.
