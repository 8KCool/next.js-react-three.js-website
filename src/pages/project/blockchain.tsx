                    We are developing a new layer 1 blockchain as the data facilitation layer of our smart city operating system.
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                    We have taken a new approach to blockchain which leans more towards the original ideals of the Bitcoin Whitepaper and away from the more recent Proof of Stake projects. However, we donâ€™t use Proof of Work and have instead created our own novel consensus mechanism for real world environments, which has far greater potential than existing solutions. This allows us a wider scope to tackle bigger problems than would otherwise be possible due to the constraints of existing technologies.
                    </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <h2>So what do we do differently?</h2>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                    We are more a technology company than a typical Web3 startup, so we are building with practical objectives in mind and are not anonymous - we are fully doxxed. Philosophically we are basically a Social Enterprise as, although we are not registered as one, we will hard-code protections to ensure a fair, equitable and good solution for everyone, regardless of background.
                    </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                    Our blockchain is the base layer of our smart city operating system. It is designed for data facilitation - to store data as safely and economically as possible and with integrated urban data validation. It will store both immutable and mutable data while enabling a new kind of integration between our real and digital selves, facilitated by our utility NFT-based and validated Trigan Citizenship. This is required to ensure that there is only one active identity per person as we are introducing a new kind of universal basic income and other local economy related enablements in addition to fully democratic voting. 
                    </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                    We believe that the Trigan urban OS has the potential to make cities smarter, safer, and more connected than ever before.
