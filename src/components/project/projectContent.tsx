            A blockchain is a decentralised, distributed database that stores a continuously growing list of records called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks. The database is secured through cryptography, which makes it resistant to tampering and revision. One way to think about a blockchain is to compare it with living systems since it functions as a decentralised network. In a decentralised network, there is no central authority or single control point. Instead, the network comprises a group of interconnected nodes that validate and record transactions. This is similar to how a group of cells in a living organism can work together to perform a specific function. <br /> <br /> Another way to think about the relationship between blockchain and living systems is in terms of adaptability and resilience. The decentralised nature of a blockchain allows it to be highly adaptable, as the network can continue to function even if one or more nodes fail. This is similar to how a living system can continue to work even if one or more cells are damaged or destroyed. In both cases, the decentralised nature of the system allows it to be more resilient and withstand external challenges. Trigan has developed a unique layer 1 blockchain that serves as the data facilitation layer for our smart city operating system. Our approach to blockchain is focused on practical objectives and transparency, and we are fully doxxed as a socially responsible enterprise. We have created a novel consensus mechanism that is tailored for real-world environments, allowing us to tackle larger problems than would be possible with current technologies. Our blockchain facilitates the safe and economic storage of data with integrated urban data validation, and supports both immutable and mutable data storage. This enables a new level of integration between our digital and physical selves, facilitated by our utility NFT-based and validated Trigan Citizenship. </p> <blockquote>

          <p>
          Economies are an integral part of society and are shaped by the interactions and relationships between individuals, businesses, and institutions. In a market-based economy, individuals and businesses engage in the production, distribution, and exchange of goods and services in order to satisfy their own needs and desires, as well as those of others. As people engage in economic activities, there may be individuals or businesses that are willing to engage in unethical or illegal activities in order to increase their own profits or gain an advantage over their competitors. If there are no consequences for these types of behaviors, or if the rewards for engaging in them are greater than the potential risks, then it is likely that they will continue to occur.
In the long term, such behaviors can have negative consequences for society as a whole, as they can erode trust and undermine the integrity of economic systems.
<br/><br/> Moreover, even when individuals do act with integrity and try to do what is right, they may still be disadvantaged by factors such as discrimination or systemic biases. This can create a sense of unfairness and undermine trust in the system as a whole.
In order to prevent these types of behaviors from being rewarded and enabled, it is important for societies to have strong systems of laws and regulations that protect individuals and businesses from exploitation and ensure that economic activities are conducted fairly and ethically. It is also important for individuals and businesses to act with integrity and to hold themselves accountable for their actions, as this can help to create a stronger, more sustainable economic system for everyone.
However, any system that is solely reliant on human implementation or management is susceptible to corruption and unfairness. This is because humans are not infallible and can be swayed by their own self-interest or personal gain. If a system does not have adequate checks and balances in place to prevent corruption and unfairness, then it is likely that these problems will arise.

          At Trigan, we are driven by a strong belief in the potential of every person to learn, earn, and live a better quality of life. We recognize that many urban communities are held back by disconnected economies that contribute to widespread poverty, inequality, and deprivation. These missed opportunities to create thriving, productive communities are a significant challenge that we are committed to addressing.
          That's why we are working to create a new kind of economy that is more connected, inclusive, and equitable. By bringing people together and empowering them to succeed, we believe that we can create a brighter future for urban communities around the world. Our goal is to build a more sustainable, equitable, and prosperous future for everyone, and we are dedicated to using every tool at our disposal to achieve this vision. Join us in this effort and be a part of something special as we work to create a brighter future for urban communities everywhere.

</h2>

          <p> At Trigan, we are using digital twins to create a brighter future for urban communities. Digital twins are virtual representations of real-world situations or environments that can be used to identify and solve problems. While they are often used on a small scale for production and logistics, we are taking a more comprehensive approach to creating smart, connected towns and cities.

Our virtual reality development team is working to create a new kind of data-enabled experience where people can live, work, and socialize in a 3D virtual world that is both helpful and entertaining. By building on our urban blockchain technology and using historical and real-time data, we are creating digital twins of real-world communities that can inform urban planners and administrators about the issues that affect their cities.

We believe that the metaverse should be community-focused, so we are also providing tools for people to personalise and improve their virtual communities. Join us on this journey and be a part of something special as we work to create a better world for everyone through the power of digital twins and urban innovation </p>
