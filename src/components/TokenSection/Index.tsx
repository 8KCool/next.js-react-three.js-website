            Your Future in your Own Hands.<strong>The Trigan Nation</strong> is a new interpretation of a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation <strong>(DAO)</strong> with one major difference - we believe that payments have no place in an honest democratic voting system. Trigan Nation <strong>empowers people and communities</strong> to change how people can live their lives. Please consider joining to help us build a better future together, today.We have a <strong>new consensus approach with reputation</strong> as an important factor. This means that everyone in our community will have their own <strong>individual identity</strong>, which we call the <strong>Trigan Citizenship NFT Passport.</strong> These will provide <strong>voting rights, access to our Universal Basic Income implementation (UBI) and support services</strong> to provide personalised opportunities for growth and self-improvement.For a very limited time, those who pre-register their interest in joining the Trigan Nation will be entitled to claim <strong>their own Trigan Citizenship NFT Passport for free!</strong>
